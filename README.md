# LibraryClass
The Library class provides a framework to store multiple Book - objects of the Book class and mimics the functions of a real library. The Library class can turn a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a book and author, into book objects. Books can be displayed in an organized fashion, checked out, and returned.
